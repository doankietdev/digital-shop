Even though the Xiaomi Mi 4 went on sale back in the summer of 2014, it succeeded in staying relevant for over 20 months and surpassed the lifespan of many competitors. Xiaomi surely took the time to make the Mi 5 worthy of the flagship series name.","The Mi 5 was the first Xiaomi phone to be unveiled under the massive spotlight of the world's biggest mobile expo - the MWC in Barcelona. And with its stunning looks and capable performance, the Mi 5 deserved nothing less.","The Xiaomi Mi 5 is instantly likeable - the new flagship comes with unbelievably thin bezels, a sharp profile, a curved back and a lightweight body - all adding to one of the most impressive exteriors a modern smartphones can hope for.","Then you learn that inside there is the latest Snapdragon 820 chipset, a new 16MP camera with 4-axis optical stabilization and yet no camera hump, generous storage options, rich connectivity options, and a beefy battery.

It has the looks of a brand new flagship, the heart of a dragon and an adventurous dual camera setup suited for every occasion. But there’s more than what meets the eye, the Magic Slot. The LG G5 is a modular smartphone, which lets you plug a handful of external add-ons: a semi-pro camera grip with shutter buttons and a bigger battery, or an external sound amplifier by B&O.","How long since you last saw the inside of your phone? It seems like while everyone was busy experimenting with designs and mixing up various alloys, there was something unusual cooking in the LG labs.","Brand new or just well forgotten old, innovating for its own sake or trying to defy the impossible, the modular design won't let you upgrade the processor or the camera, but it certainly offers plenty of options. The add-ons will mostly be sold separately but initial prices don't seem too bad. You might even get a bonus camera grip - LG will throw one in the bundle in select markets. Who knows, we might see the return of the xenon flash or some smart docking solutions along the lines of Microsoft's Continuum.","What you do get right out of the box is the base equipment and in the case of the G5, it's anything but modest. Perhaps the star of the show is the camera combo. The 16MP camera borrowed from the LG V10 does top-notch stills, and the secondary 8MP sensor offers unmatched super wide shots while adding a hybrid zoom of sorts to the package."],"brand":"662f9f02572b2a2aca6bef31","price":14953555,"sold":40,"thumb":"https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/modular-type-1600x840_G5_M01C_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404872","variants":[{"name":"CERAMIC","images":["https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/modular-type-1600x840_G5_M01C_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404872","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/lg-g5-3_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404872","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/lg-g5-01_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404872","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/lg-g5-1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404872","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/lg-g5-02_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404872"],"quantity":82},{"name":"Gold","images":["https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/modular-type-1600x840_G5_M01C_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404872","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/lg-g5-3_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404872","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/lg-g5-01_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404872","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/lg-g5-1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404872","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/lg-g5-02_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404872"],"quantity":2},{"name":"CERAMIC","images":["https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/modular-type-1600x840_G5_M01C_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404872","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/lg-g5-3_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404872","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/lg-g5-01_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404872","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/lg-g5-1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404872","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/lg-g5-02_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404872"],"quantity":57},{"name":"Gold","images":["https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/modular-type-1600x840_G5_M01C_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404872","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/lg-g5-3_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404872","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/lg-g5-01_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404872","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/lg-g5-1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404872","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/lg-g5-02_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404872"],"quantity":5}],"averageRatings":4,"createdAt":"2024-04-29T13:21:54.927Z","updatedAt":"2024-04-29T13:21:54.927Z"},{"_id":"662f9eefd5bbafa4395df254","category":"662f9edad5bbafa4395df249","title":"iPhone 7","slug":"iphone-7-1714396911084","specs":[{"k":"Technology","v":"GSM / CDMA / HSPA / EVDO / LTE"},{"k":"Dimensions","v":"138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm"},{"k":"Weight","v":"138 g"},{"k":"Display","v":"LED-backlit IPS LCD 4.7\""},{"k":"Resolution","v":"1334 x 750"},{"k":"OS","v":"iOS 10"},{"k":"Chipset","v":"Apple A10 Fusion"},{"k":"CPU","v":"Quad-core"},{"k":"Internal","v":"32/128 GB, 2 GB RAM"},{"k":"Camera","v":"12 MP -

A full smartphone package experience without compromise. The problem with this idea is that it doesn't exist, there will always be some phone with a better camera or better battery or a larger display. But we can always look at this idea subjectively and find the right balance between what the phone offers versus compromises you might be making.","It's been quiet in HTC camp lately but it seems the company has been gearing up for its big comeback this year. HTC's relevancy had been slipping away the past couple of years and the Taiwanese company thought it should buckle down and listen to what its customers have been saying for a while. And the fans, on the other hand, are excited to learn that \"HTC is back!\"","Before the HTC 10, pretty much every iteration of the HTC One series in recent years brought some form of compromise. The HTC One M7 had a great camera, the first of its kind, the problem was only 4MP did not allow any sort of cropping without anyone noticing. The HTC One M8 had the same 4 megapixel camera and HTC made a bad choice to even remove OIS from the flagship.","The HTC One M9 was a step in the right direction, but it was not enough. Even with a bigger camera sensor this time around, the camera performance was still lackluster. The One M9 was also plagued with overheating problems caused by an early version of the Snapdragon 810 which had to be downclocked just to avoid the heating issues. As a result, the HTC's M9 unofficially became the flagship to avoid."],"brand":"662f9f02572b2a2aca6bef33","price":13103369,"sold":84,"thumb":"https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/HTC-10-1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404875","variants":[{"name":"Black","images":["https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/HTC-10-1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404875","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/htc-10-5_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404875","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/htc-10-r_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404875"],"quantity":1},{"name":"Black","images":["https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/HTC-10-1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404875","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/htc-10-5_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404875","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/htc-10-r_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404875"],"quantity":92},{"name":"Blue","images":["https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/HTC-10-1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404875","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/htc-10-5_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404875","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/htc-10-r_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404875"],"quantity":23},{"images":["https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/HTC-10-1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404875","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/htc-10-5_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404875","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/htc-10-r_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404875"],"quantity":91}],"averageRatings":1,"createdAt":"2024-04-29T13:21:53.394Z","updatedAt":"2024-04-29T13:21:53.394Z"},{"_id":"662f9ef5d5bbafa4395df289","category":"662f9edad5bbafa4395df249","title":"Google Pixel","slug":"google-pixel-1714396917969","specs":[{"k":"Technology","v":"GSM / CDMA / HSPA / EVDO / LTE"},{"k":"Dimensions","v":"143.8 x 69.5 x 8.5 mm"},{"k":"Weight","v":"143 g"},{"k":"Display","v":"AMOLED 5.0 inches"},{"k":"Resolution","v":"1080 x 1920"},{"k":"OS","v":"Android OS, v7.1 (Nougat)"},{"k":"Chipset","v":"Snapdragon 821"},{"k":"CPU","v":"Quad-core"},{"k":"Internal","v":"32/128 GB, 4 GB RAM"},{"k":"Camera","v":"12.3 MP, f/2.0 -

It's been the bang-for-buck benchmark for a while now, delivering a feature set and performance way above what its price tag suggests.","To refresh your memory Xiaomi launched the Redmi Note 3 at the turn of last year and it was powered by a MediaTek Helio X10. In the spring of 2016, a Qualcomm-driven Redmi Note 3 followed and broke the company's sales record in India. Now this full review admittedly comes a little late, but the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 is still on many people's radar, so we figured a way to compare the Mediatek-powered original and the Snapdragon edition might come in handy.","Besides the chipset, there's also a new camera sensor, a 16MP unit even if it is limited to 1080p video recording. Another difference is the second SIM card tray can now take microSD cards. It's the hybrid kind, which isn't ideal for people who want to have it all. Other than that, the hardware is perfectly familiar."],"brand":"662f9f02572b2a2aca6bef2d","price":4460468,"sold":97,"thumb":"https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/Untitled-1_1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404888","variants":[{"name":"Blue","images":["https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/Untitled-1_1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404888","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/SS6_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404888","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/xiaomi-redmi-note-3-1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404888","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/xiaomi-redmi-note-3-2_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404888","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/xiaomi-redmi-note-3-3_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404889"],"quantity":67},{"name":"White","images":["https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/Untitled-1_1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404888","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/SS6_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404888","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/xiaomi-redmi-note-3-1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404888","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/xiaomi-redmi-note-3-2_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404888","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/xiaomi-redmi-note-3-3_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404889"],"quantity":51},{"name":"Black","images":["https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/Untitled-1_1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404888","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/SS6_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404888","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/xiaomi-redmi-note-3-1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404888","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/xiaomi-redmi-note-3-2_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404888","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/xiaomi-redmi-note-3-3_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404889"],"quantity":71},{"name":"Gold","images":["https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/Untitled-1_1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404888","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/SS6_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404888","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/xiaomi-redmi-note-3-1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404888","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/xiaomi-redmi-note-3-2_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404888","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/xiaomi-redmi-note-3-3_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404889"],"quantity":82}],"averageRatings":1,"createdAt":"2024-04-29T13:21:54.627Z","updatedAt":"2024-04-29T13:21:54.627Z"},{"_id":"662f9ef2d5bbafa4395df268","category":"662f9edad5bbafa4395df24a","title":"Sony Xperia Z4 Tablet LTE","slug":"sony-xperia-z4-tablet-lte-1714396914760","specs":[{"k":"Technology","v":"GSM / HSPA / LTE"},{"k":"Dimensions","v":"254 x 167 x 6.1 mm"},{"k":"Weight","v":"393 g"},{"k":"Display","v":"IPS LCD 10.1 inches"},{"k":"Resolution","v":"2560 x 1600"},{"k":"OS","v":"Android OS, v5.0 (Lollipop)"},{"k":"Chipset","v":"Snapdragon 810"},{"k":"CPU","v":"Octa-core"},{"k":"Internal","v":"32 GB, 3 GB RAM"},{"k":"Camera","v":"8.1 MP - 5.1 MP"}],"description":["The Sony Xperia Z4 Tablet faces the daunting task of flying the Z4 banner, when the Xperia Z4 smartphone is just an incremental update limited to the Japanese market. The 10.1-inch tablet seems up for the task however with contemporary specs, attractive styling and razor-thin profile.","The Xperia Z4 Tablet builds on the virtues of the Z2 Tablet from a year ago and the improvements are much easier to spot than in the Xperia smartphone range where Sony's twice-a-year release cycle has meant more gradual evolution.","We weren't particularly satisfied with the low 224ppi of the predecessor, rather thin even by last year's standards and we're happy to note that the tablet's display resolution has been brought up to date and is now 2,560 x 1,600 pixels.","Sony's design language has remained unchanged for a while, and while it may be getting a bit tired, it's stylish nonetheless. A few excess millimeters have been trimmed off the footprint, while thickness has been brought down to match the Apple iPad Air 2 at 6.1mm. And perhaps most importantly, an IP68 certification means you can submerge it in water for up to 30min and 1.5m in depth, without fearing for its life.","Most impressively, the tablet weighs just 393g, a good 10% lighter than both the predecessor and the Cupertino rival. Meanwhile, battery capacity hasn't been sacrificed and has remained at 6,000mAh, but will that be enough to power 80% percent more pixels and more capable chipset?","Speaking of chipsets, a whole year warrants an improvement in the innards and the Snapdragon 810 has replaced the S801 of the Xperia Z2 Tablet. We're only left to hope that Sony has managed to leverage the large surface area to benefit the heat dissipation and we finally the Snapdragon live up to its potential.","We have the LTE version of the tablet which comes with the added benefit of cellular connectivity. There's also a WI-Fi only model, but our findings should apply equally well to that one too. For the sake of simplicity we'll drop the LTE abbreviation for the rest of this review."],"brand":"662f9f02572b2a2aca6bef2f","price":17716161,"sold":19,"thumb":"https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/Untitled-11_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404927","variants":[{"images":["https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/Untitled-11_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404927","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/sony-xperia-z4-tablet-1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404927","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/sony-xperia-z4-tablet-1_1221094a-62fa-48fe-92bf-24290926cc56_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404927","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/sony-xperia-z4-tablet-2_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404927","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/sony-xperia-z4-tablet-2_dbebeed1-de5c-4bff-9c53-8aa708c32ca5_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404927"],"quantity":33},{"images":["https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/Untitled-11_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404927","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/sony-xperia-z4-tablet-1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404927","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/sony-xperia-z4-tablet-1_1221094a-62fa-48fe-92bf-24290926cc56_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404927","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/sony-xperia-z4-tablet-2_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404927","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/sony-xperia-z4-tablet-2_dbebeed1-de5c-4bff-9c53-8aa708c32ca5_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404927"],"quantity":2},{"name":"White","images":["https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/Untitled-11_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404927","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/sony-xperia-z4-tablet-1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404927","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/sony-xperia-z4-tablet-1_1221094a-62fa-48fe-92bf-24290926cc56_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404927","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/sony-xperia-z4-tablet-2_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404927","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/sony-xperia-z4-tablet-2_dbebeed1-de5c-4bff-9c53-8aa708c32ca5_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404927"],"quantity":40},{"name":"Black","images":["https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/Untitled-11_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404927","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/sony-xperia-z4-tablet-1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404927","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/sony-xperia-z4-tablet-1_1221094a-62fa-48fe-92bf-24290926cc56_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404927","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/sony-xperia-z4-tablet-2_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404927","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/sony-xperia-z4-tablet-2_dbebeed1-de5c-4bff-9c53-8aa708c32ca5_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404927"],"quantity":36}],"averageRatings":4,"createdAt":"2024-04-29T13:21:54.760Z","updatedAt":"2024-04-29T13:21:54.760Z"},{"_id":"662f9ef2d5bbafa4395df263","category":"662f9edad5bbafa4395df24a","title":"Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 LTE","slug":"samsung-galaxy-tab-s-84-lte-1714396914482","specs":[{"k":"Technology","v":"GSM / HSPA / LTE"},{"k":"Dimensions","v":"212.8 x 125.6 x 6.6 mm"},{"k":"Weight","v":"298 g"},{"k":"Display","v":"Super AMOLED 8.4 inches"},{"k":"Resolution","v":"1600 x 2560"},{"k":"OS","v":"Android OS, v4.4.2 (KitKat)"},{"k":"Chipset","v":"Snapdragon 800"},{"k":"CPU","v":"Quad-core 2.3 GHz"},{"k":"Internal","v":"16/32 GB, 3 GB RAM"},{"k":"Camera","v":"8 MP - 2.1 MP"}],"description":["Ever since the 2011 unveiling of the Galaxy Tab 7.7 we've been waiting for the next generation of Super AMOLED tablets.

part thereof, the iPad Pro was made official in September 2015 and is shipping worldwide as we speak. Guess we already know what's been going on under the surface but the bottom line is Apple lets you decide about the optional pencil and keyboard.","At 12.9 inches of display diagonal, the iPad Pro is Apple's largest tablet and largest handheld device running iOS, considering there are a couple of smaller MacBooks.","But while size quite obviously matters, there's more to the giant iPad than its sheer scale. A couple of firsts for Apple are also part of the package, though they naturally come at an extra cost.","First up is the Pencil. It's an easy target of ridicule, given Steve Jobs' abhorrence of the stylus, expressed at the original iPhone's launch. However, the Pencil here serves a fundamentally different purpose to a stylus on a smartphone, and the jokes are mostly groundless. The Pencil is an active battery powered device and houses all the tech needed for precise measurement of not only different levels of pressure, but also tilt, so that it's able to reproduce your drawing digitally with all its nuances as you would expect from say, a specialized Wacom tablet.","It's the Smart Keyboard that's more entertaining, however, at least for us. Well, depending on which side of the line you are in the so-called Surface tension. If you need it to, the iPad Pro can be equipped with a foldable keyboard dock/kickstand, which you can buy separately, just like you would the Apple Pencil.","Done with the trivia, the iPad Pro is a seriously capable machine with a huge display, a formidable A9X chip and 4GB of RAM, all powered by an extra large battery."],"brand":"662f9f02572b2a2aca6bef32","price":35483012,"sold":50,"thumb":"https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/ss5_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404844","variants":[{"name":"Blue","images":["https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/ss5_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404844","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/apple-ipad-pro-2_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404844","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/apple-ipad-pro-3_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404844","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/apple-ipad-pro-4_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404844","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/apple-ipad-pro-5_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404844"],"quantity":46},{"name":"Black","images":["https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/ss5_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404844","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/apple-ipad-pro-2_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404844","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/apple-ipad-pro-3_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404844","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/apple-ipad-pro-4_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404844","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/apple-ipad-pro-5_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404844"],"quantity":98},{"name":"Gold","images":["https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/ss5_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404844","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/apple-ipad-pro-2_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404844","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/apple-ipad-pro-3_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404844","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/apple-ipad-pro-4_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404844","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/apple-ipad-pro-5_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404844"],"quantity":35},{"name":"Black","images":["https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/ss5_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404844","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/apple-ipad-pro-2_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404844","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/apple-ipad-pro-3_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404844","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/apple-ipad-pro-4_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404844","https://digital-world-2.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/apple-ipad-pro-5_1024x1024.jpg?v=1491404844"],"quantity":31}],"averageRatings":3,"createdAt":"2024-04-29T13:21:56.489Z","updatedAt":"2024-04-29T13:21:56.489Z"},{"_id":"662f9ef3d5bbafa4395df270","category":"662f9edad5bbafa4395df24a","title":"Apple iPad Air 2","slug":"apple-ipad-air-2-1714396915163","specs":[{"k":"Technology","v":"GSM / CDMA / HSPA / EVDO / LTE"},{"k":"Dimensions","v":"240 x 169.5 x 6.1 mm"},{"k":"Weight","v":"437 g"},{"k":"Display","v":"LED-backlit IPS LCD 9.7 inches"},{"k":"Resolution","v":"1536 x 2048"},{"k":"OS","v":"iOS 8.1"},{"k":"Chipset","v":"Apple A8X"},{"k":"CPU","v":"Triple-core 1.5 GHz Typhoon"},{"k":"Internal","v":"16/32/64/128 GB, 2 GB RAM"},{"k":"Camera","v":"8 MP, f/2.4 - 1.2 MP, f/2.2"}],"description":["Another millimeter thinner, the new iPad Air 2 has a body that's even more befitting the ethereal moniker the iPad bears second year in a row. Outside of that little fact however, the changes may not be as easy to spot. And that's hardly a surprise.","Apple's laser focus on making the ultimate tablet keeps the entire tablet industry moving forward. But in their camp, large strides are usually followed by baby steps and not all products end up as the breakthroughs we would have liked to see. One thing's for sure though, Apple certainly likes to keep us on the edge of our seats when it comes to what their next gen devices would look or feel like.","This year, the Air 2 is hardly hitting like an airstrike, but it still does a mighty fine job of keeping up the alpha male image. True, besides the slimmer profile the changes are hard to see. A nice exception is the screen, where the specs may sound the same on paper, but improvements are visible to the naked eye in terms of reflectivity and outdoor legibility.","The iPad Air 2 also has a better camera, an 8 megapixel auto focus unit, for what it's worth on a ten-incher, and as usual, Apple's latest and greatest chipset to make sure things are running faster than ever before.","So that about sums up the noteworthy things the iPad Air 2 brings to the table.
